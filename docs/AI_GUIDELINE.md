# AI Usage Guidelines

At Git Karma, we embrace the use of AI tools (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude) to enhance productivity, but we believe in responsible and transparent usage.

## Principles

1.  **Transparency**: If a significant portion of your contribution (code or documentation) was generated by AI, please mention it in the Pull Request description.
2.  **Review & Understanding**: You are responsible for the code you submit. Do not blindly copy-paste AI-generated code. You must understand how it works and verify it meets the project's standards.
3.  **Testing**: AI-generated code is prone to subtle bugs. Ensure you have added adequate tests to verify the behavior.
4.  **Copyright & Ethics**: Do not use AI to generate code that infringes on existing licenses or copyrights. Ensure the generated code is compatible with the MIT license of this project.

## Best Practices

- Use AI to generate boilerplate, write tests, or explain complex logic.
- Use AI to refine documentation and check for grammar.
- Always review the generated code for security vulnerabilities.

# 🧠 Brainstorming (Feature Ideas)

This is a dump of wild, unrefined, and potential future ideas for GitKarma.
Nothing here is promised. Feel free to add your own crazy ideas via PR!

## 🌌 Moonshots (Wild Ideas)
- [ ] **Karma Decay**: Should Karma slowly decay if you stop contributing? (Anti-hoarding mechanism).
- [ ] **Karma for Code Review**: Award Karma not just for coding, but for reviewing PRs.
- [ ] **"Bounty" Mode**: Allow maintainers to attach a massive Karma bounty to a specific critical bug.
- [ ] **Physical Swag Store**: Exchange 10,000 Karma for a GitKarma T-shirt?
- [ ] **AI Code Review Bot**: An AI that auto-reviews PRs and awards small "Clean Code" Karma bonuses.

## 🤝 Community & Social
- [ ] **Guilds/Teams**: Create a "Guild" and pool Karma together to unlock massive repositories.
- [ ] **Mentorship Matching**: High-Karma users (Senpai) matched with beginners (Kohai) for 1-on-1 guidance.
- [ ] **Rivalry**: "Your rival X just earned 50 Karma. Don't let them win!" notifications.
- [ ] **Contributor Spotlight**: Weekly interview with the top Giver.

## 🔌 Integrations
- [ ] **GitLab / Bitbucket Support**: Expand beyond GitHub.
- [ ] **Slack / Discord Bot**: "User X just earned 500 Karma!" announcements in community channels.
- [ ] **IDE Plugins**: VS Code extension to see the "Karma Value" of an issue directly in the editor.



## ⛔ Anti-Features (Will Not Do)
- **Pay-to-Win**: Buying Karma or visibility with real money.
- **Crypto Tokenization**: Karma will never be a tradeable crypto token.
- **Ads**: No advertisements.
- **Direct Payments**: No direct financial transactions between users on the platform.
